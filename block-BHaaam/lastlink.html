<p>Tastes like strawberries
    On a summer evenin'
    And it sounds just like a song
    I want more berries
    And that summer feelin'
    It's so wonderful and warm
    Breathe me in
    Breathe me out
    I don't know if I could ever go without
    I'm just thinking out loud
    I don't know if I could ever go without
    Watermelon sugar high
    Watermelon sugar high
    Watermelon sugar high
    Watermelon sugar high
    Watermelon sugar
    Strawberries on a summer evenin'
    Baby, you're the end of June
    I want your belly
    And that summer feelin'
    Getting washed away in you
    Breathe me in
    Breathe me out
    I don't know if I could ever go without
